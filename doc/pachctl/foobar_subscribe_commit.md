## foobar subscribe commit

Print commits as they are created (finished).

### Synopsis


Print commits as they are created in the specified repo and branch.  By default, all existing commits on the specified branch are returned first.  A commit is only considered 'created' when it's been finished.

```
foobar subscribe commit <repo>@<branch>
```

### Examples

```
```sh

# subscribe to commits in repo "test" on branch "master"
$ foobar subscribe commit test@master

# subscribe to commits in repo "test" on branch "master", but only since commit XXX.
$ foobar subscribe commit test@master --from XXX

# subscribe to commits in repo "test" on branch "master", but only for new commits created from now on.
$ foobar subscribe commit test@master --new
```
```

### Options

```
      --from string       subscribe to all commits since this commit
      --full-timestamps   Return absolute timestamps (as opposed to the default, relative timestamps).
      --new               subscribe to only new commits created from now on
      --raw               disable pretty printing, print raw json
```
